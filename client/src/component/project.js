                   It allows for blood transfusion as a life-sustaining and life-saving procedure. 
                   Over one hundred million units of blood are donated each year throughout the world. 
                   This activity reviews donor eligibility and selection, adverse effects of donation, 
                   and pathogen reduction and inactivation for donated blood.
                   You must be in good health at the time you donate. 
                   You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, 
                   cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection. 
                   If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.</p>
